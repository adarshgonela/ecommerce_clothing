You will need to create an API with Mistral AI to access Mistral AI language models. Create an account at Mistral AI registration page and generate the token on the API Keys page. The Spring AI project defines a configuration property named spring.ai.mistralai.api-key that you should set to the value of the API Key obtained from console.mistral.ai. Exporting an environment variable is one way to set that configuration property:

export SPRING_AI_MISTRALAI_API_KEY=<INSERT KEY HERE>
